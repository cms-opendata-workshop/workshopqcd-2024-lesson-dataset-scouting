No files need to be downloaded before this lesson. Most of this lesson can be worked through a web broswer. Episode 5 introduces a command line tool to inspect and download open data files and their metadata, and it will require using a Unix terminal (Linux, MacOS terminal, or Windows WSL2 Ubuntu terminal).
