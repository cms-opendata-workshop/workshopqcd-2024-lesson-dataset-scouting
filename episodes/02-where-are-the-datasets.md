You should definitely take some time to explore it. But for now we will select the 
CMS data.

This does not work as the deployment looks for it in
https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshopqcd-2024-lesson-dataset-scouting/files/portal_screenshot_landing_page.png
move to ../assets/img/ (No) or ../assets/images and see if a miracle happens... NO!
Under episodes/figures See https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper, still no success
From none of these places does it deployed to the gh-pages branch from where the site is served.
Try episodes/fig as in https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-development-training/tree/main/episodes/fig
